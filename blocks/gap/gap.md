If you need to have gaps between any blocks, you can use global `nb-gap_SIDE_SIZE` classes.

### Sides

Sides are `top`, `right`, `bottom` and `left`, each such class would add the margin of the given `SIZE` at the corresponding side:

    'class': ['nb-gap_top_SIZE']

    'class': ['nb-gap_right_SIZE']

    'class': ['nb-gap_bottom_SIZE']

    'class': ['nb-gap_left_SIZE']

### Sizes

There are a few of possible preset sizes for gaps: `xs`, `s`, `m` and `l`. Each side have a modifier for each size, creating classes like `nb-gap_top_xs` etc.

    'class': ['nb-gap_SIDE_xs']

    'class': ['nb-gap_SIDE_s']

    'class': ['nb-gap_SIDE_m']

    'class': ['nb-gap_SIDE_l']
